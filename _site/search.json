    "text": "Before starting her lab in San Diego, Tiffany earned a B.S. in Biological Engineering at MIT and went on to conduct graduate research with Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri as part of the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics PhD program at Harvard Medical School, where she studied the genetic susceptibility of autoimmune diseases and other polygenic diseases. During graduate school, Tiffany developed machine learning methods to predict the functionality of regulatory variants, which had applications to transcription factor binding prediction, eQTL mapping, heritability enrichment analysis, and trans-ancestry portability of polygenic risk scores. She pursued post-doctoral research studying tissue-mediated genetic effects with Dr. Alkes Price at the Harvard School of Public Health. Now, Tiffany is an Assistant Professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and the Department of Medicine at the University of California San Diego. In her free time, Tiffany enjoys hiking, tennis, beach volleyball, and spending time with her dog, Dax."

    "text": "Research Interests\nCurrently, health-related discoveries from the field of human genetics disproportionately benefit individuals of European descent, due to the longstanding Eurocentric bias in data collection and study design. I am particularly motivated to work with ancestrally diverse patient cohorts and develop statistical genetics methods that can be applied to data from multiple populations; most methods have only been applied to European populations and cannot be applied to more than one population at a time.\nI am generally interested in studying the complex nature of the genetic susceptibility of human disease and phenotypes. The precise biological mechanisms through which genetic variation is mediated to impact complex traits and diseases remain largely uncertain. I am interested in studying intermediate phenotypes such as gene and protein expression, while also understanding how environmental factors can modulate genetic risk. My previous work has approached these questions from a population genetics perspective, leveraging large biobank data, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the UK Biobank and Biobank Japan, consortium-level functional data, such as from ENCODE, and gene expression studies, such as from GTEx.\n– Tiffany Amariuta, Principal Investigator"
